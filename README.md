# Learning References


This post mainly focuses for students who are preparing for SDE positions

My goto languages are Python and Java for interviews



## Do's while preparing

*Fix only two or three sources for preparation*

*Read through the whole source till the end*

*Stick to one or two technologies you are most comfortable with*

*Master one language then only move to another*

*Prepare well in advance even before applying*

*Aim for companies before applying and focus on company specific preparation if possible as each company has different interview process*



## Don't 

*Don't go for too many free sources as you might end up working on same concept again and again and get caught up in the loop*

*Don't keep switching between technologies*
